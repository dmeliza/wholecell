function [time,data,n,stdev] = TimeBin(time, data, bins, option)
%
% Rebins data into new timing vector.
%
% [TIME,DATA,N,STD] = TIMEBIN(time, data, binwidth) uses a fixed binwidth
% (units are those of the time vector).  Bins with more than one
% data point are represented by the mean, while bins with no data
% points are dropped from the output vector.  Note that the bins generated
% begin on the first integer multiple of the binsize (which comes in useful
% when comparing multiple datasets as this synchronizes the data).  The number
% of points in each bin and the standard deviation are also returned.
%
% [TIME,DATA,N,STD] = TIMEBIN(time, data, bins), where BINS is a vector of
% length greater than 1, rebins the data into the vector.  Invalid and
% empty time points are dropped.
%
% [TIME,DATA] = TIMEBIN(...,'interp') uses the INTERP1 function to perform
% the operation.  Note that this tends to follow the input curve quite closely,
% especially if time bins line up with input time values.
