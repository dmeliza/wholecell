
To do:

$Revision$

alignepisodes function - done
color traces in gui - done (retain color when baseline/episodes are reprocced)
delete traces - done
save subset of traces -done

fix color by clicking
unify select and zoom mode - doesn't work; zoom has to be off to avoid zooming
                             (maybe try control-clicking?)
hide and show marks -done 
smoothed statistics and average -done (needs spline toolbox now...)

a dialog to rescale the data
