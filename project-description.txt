A message-driven framework for controlling a patch-clamp amplifier through
a national instruments board.  A central controller object controls data 
acquisition and output.

I am using matlab's somewhat clutzy class structure to describe the controller
object.

End-user modules should be written to make use of the controller object; the
controller should be inherited for specific pieces of equipment.

The initial implementation will only allow one module to access the controller
at once; this will elminate the need to write subscription code.

The use of callbacks is an attempt to make this code as object-oriented as possible
