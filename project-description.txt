Project description:
CVS: $Id$

WholeCell is a matlab-based data acquisition and analysis program. It is
based to some extent on PClamp (Axon Instruments) and Exper (Zach Mainen,
CSHL), but is more of a one-off design intended for controlling an
AxoClamp amplifier and stimulus presentation equipment.

Because the stimulus presentation parameters and the analysis is going to
vary from experiment to experiment, the design of the project is based
around a central application that controls the national instruments board
and runs protocols, which are matlab files that make use of instruments
accessed through the national instruments board via the main application.

Like exper there is a central control structure which is made available
globally to protocol files.  Unlike exper, protocols cannot operate
independently of one another, and thus there is no precendence of
operation.

This control structure has the following structure:

wc.ai - analog input object
wc.ao - analog output object
wc.control - stored information about the operation of the daq
    .telegraph - telegraph channel indices
    .amplifier - scaled output from the amplifer (channel pointer)
    .availableChannels - array of numbers indicating available hardware lines
    .channels - array of numbers indicating used hardware lines
wc.main - properties of the main window
wc.(modulename) - data used within a protocol

Acquired data is accessed through callbacks, which run through the
central application and then are passed on to whatever protocol
currently has control.
