Project description:
CVS: $Id$

A message-driven framework for controlling a patch-clamp amplifier through
a national instruments board.  A central controller m-file generates and
receives messages from subscriber modules; these messages contain control
programs and results.  Everything is episode-based.

Messages are sent to the control object with the following stub

varargout = controller(command_name, h, eventdata, handles, varargin)

This is similar to the callbacks used by matlab's GUI functions, which should
make it easy to make GUI-driven modules whose behavior can be triggered by
the arrival or loss of data.

The initial implementation will only allow one module to access the controller
at once; this will elminate the need to write subscription code.

The use of callbacks is an attempt to make this code as object-oriented as possible
